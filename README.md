# BAR
Bayesian adaptive randomization.

In traditional randomized clinical trials, patients are randomly assigned to one treatment arm with equal probabilities. However, if we observe some early promising effects in one treatment group, we would like to assign more patients into that arm, and vice versa. Thus, BAR answers these questions: in an ongoing clinical trial, how can we adaptively assign patients into different arms based on current clinical performance? Can we claim a treatment effective or furtile as early as possible?

Codes are written in R. 

This is a joint project working with Dr. Gang Li and Dr. Donatello Telesca from UCLA Biostatistics.
